# Workout-Tracker "YouCoach" -- TrueCoach program creation functionality clone

This final project is a simple CRUD web application.

This app will allow a user to create an account that they can log into.

The account will be able hold all of the user's current and past completed workouts, as well as edit or delete current workouts.

The main feature of this workout tracker app is that the user can use a chatbot, where the app makes use of ChatGPT's API, and ask for workout suggestions depending on their goals. From there, the user can then make workouts themselves using the information provided by the chatbot.

** API Implementation not yet added

The project will contain a dashboard page that shows all of the user's current workouts, workout details page, workout creation page, workout edit page, and workout history page that shows the completed workouts
